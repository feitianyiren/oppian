Google Analytics for Django Projects
====================================

I manage a lot of Django projects that present slightly-different forms to 
users depending on the site/domain they're visiting.  There's also a bunch of 
custom submission code that differs from form to form, but that's neither here
nor there.

I need different Google Analytics codes depending on the sites and after 
sticking these tags into every single template, I thought it would be cool to 
be able to manage these Google analytics accounts from the Django admin page. 
I also added a mode of operation that excludes the admin interface altogether 
(you can just use the template tag)

## Two modes of operation ##

### Administering and associating codes with Django `Sites` framework ###

1. Add the `google_analytics` application to your `INSTALLED_APPS` section of your `settings.py`.  This mode requires that you be using the Django sites framework too, so make sure you have that set up as well.
2. Add `GOOGLE_ANALYTICS_MODEL = True` to your `settings.py` 
3. Run a `./manage.py syncdb` to add the database tables
4. Go to your project's admin page (usually `/admin/`) and click into a site objects
5. You'll now see a new field under the normal site information called "Analytics Code". In this box you put your unique analytics code for your project's domain.  It looks like `UA-xxxxxx-x` and save the site.
6. In your base template (usually a `base.html`) insert this tag at the very top: `{% load analytics %}`
7. In the same template, insert the following code right before the closing body tag: `{% analytics %}`

### Just using the template tag ###


1. Add the `google_analytics` application to your `INSTALLED_APPS` section of your `settings.py`.
2. In your base template, usually a `base.html`, insert this tag at the very top: `{% load analytics %}`
3. In the same template, insert the following code right before the closing body tag: `{% analytics "UA-xxxxxx-x" %}` the `UA-xxxxxx-x` is a unique Google Analytics code for you domain when you sign up for a new account.
